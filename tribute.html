                    <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> (/'α:bdǝl Kǝ'lα:m/
                    (About this soundlisten); 15 October 1931-27 July 2015) was
                    an indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th 
                    president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameshwaram, 
                    Tamilnadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four 
                    decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defense Research and 
                    Development Organization (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organization
                    (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military
                    missile Development efforts. [1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India 
                    for his work on the Development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
                    [2][3][4] He also played a pivotal Organization, technical, and political role in 
                    India's Pokharan-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test
                    by India in 1974.
